# Tag Me If You Can

This directory contains **Tag Game – Infinite Chase Evolved**, an HTML5
browser game. Open `game.html` in a modern web browser to play.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Objective:** Control the blue player and tag the red AI opponent. Every
time you collide with the AI you progress to the next level and the AI gets
slightly faster. Avoid the AI's projectiles – being hit ends the game.
- **Levels:** Levels cycle through three preset obstacle and token layouts.
Collect boost tokens while avoiding obstacles and the AI.
- **Wrapping Field:** Moving off one edge wraps you around to the opposite
side, so play happens on a continuous looped field.

## Controls

- **Arrow keys** – Move the player (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Spacebar** – Activate a speed boost once you have collected five boost
  tokens. The boost lasts about two seconds and temporarily doubles your
  speed.
- **P** – Pause or resume the game. While paused, a “Paused” overlay is shown.
- **F / Freeze Burst button** – Fire a ring of freezing bullets around the
  player. Hitting the AI freezes it for a few seconds.
- **Browser refresh** – Restart the game after a Game Over.
- **R** – Rewind to where you were two seconds ago (8‑second cooldown).
- **D** – Deploy a holographic decoy that lures the AI for three seconds.
- **Q** – Instantly swap positions with the AI (10‑second cooldown).
- **C** – Temporarily control the AI's movement for two seconds
  (12‑second cooldown).
- **E** – Release a Temporal Echo that retraces your last two seconds of
  movement. If the echo touches the AI, it freezes for a moment
  (9‑second cooldown).

## Collectables and Boosts

- **Boost Tokens:** Yellow circles scattered around each level. Collect
  five to enable a speed boost. The token counter is shown at the bottom of
  the screen.
- **Boosting:** When activated with the spacebar, the player glows yellow and
  moves faster. The token counter resets by the boost amount used.
- **Shield Tokens:** Purple circles that appear once per level. Collecting one
  grants a shield that blocks the next projectile. The current shield status is
  shown below the game.

## Losing the Game

The AI periodically shoots orange projectiles at the player. If one hits you,
"You Were Tagged Back" is displayed and the game stops. Refresh the page to
play again.

## Rewind Mechanic

Press **R** at any time to instantly return to your position from two seconds
earlier. This ability has an eight‑second cooldown, displayed at the bottom of
the game. Use it to escape a tight spot or surprise the AI with an unexpected
move.

## Holographic Decoy

Press **D** to drop a faint blue decoy at your current location. The AI will
chase the decoy instead of you for about three seconds, letting you reposition
or escape danger. The decoy disappears on its own or when a new level loads.

Enjoy the chase!

## Quantum Swap

Press **Q** to instantly trade places with the AI. This obscure ability can
flip a dangerous situation in your favor or drop the AI into a trap. It has a
ten‑second cooldown shown below the game.

## Puppeteer Hack

Press **C** to override the AI and control its movement with the arrow keys
for about two seconds. Your own player stays put while you steer the opponent.
Use this to guide the AI into obstacles or away from boost tokens. The effect
has a twelve‑second cooldown displayed at the bottom of the game.

## Temporal Echo

Press **E** to summon a shimmering afterimage that faithfully retraces the path
you took over the previous two seconds. The echo is ethereal, passing through
obstacles, but if it brushes the AI, the opponent becomes frozen for a short
time. Timing its release lets you snare the AI with your own past movements.

## Quantum Snare

Press **Z** to drop a faint white snare at your feet. The trap stays in place
for about five seconds. If the AI steps on it, the opponent is frozen in time
for three seconds, giving you a brief opening to tag it or escape. The ability
has a ten‑second cooldown shown below the game.
